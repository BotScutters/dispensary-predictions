    "# Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2012, Washington state passed I-502 and legalized the recreational sale, use, and possession of marijuana. This event has led to an explosion of development in the field that's making waves through our society. Since 2014, approximately 500 state licensed dispensaries have opened throughout the state, with nearly 150 of those here in Seattle. And the thing that gets me excited is that because of regulations, a ton of their data is publicly available, meaning I got to play with it. We can go into the weeds later about how and why it took me a thousand websites and 4 different scraping techniques to get the data, and how my R^2 varied when I went shifted from 10-30 features to estimate the monthly revenue of a cannabis dispensary. But for now, let me tell you about what I learned as I immersed myself in this dataset over the past 2 weeks. In this project I scour the web for publicly available data that might be predictive of how a cannabis dispensary performs, such as customer reviews, inventory distributions, and local demographics. I then train machine learning models to predict a dispensary's monthly revenue and analyze the resulting models to distill insights about what drives sales in the marijuana market.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I explored the question of what makes the Washington recreational cannabis market tick. I decided that if I could identify the features that most contributed to a dispensary's revenue, I could get a lot of insight out of how the features shake out. \n",
    "\n",
    "When asked what my project was, I kept saying that it was to use web scraping to predict monthly revenue using linear regression. And it was, of course it was. But that's not the point, that's not the story. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the monthly revenue of all dispensaries for the last 16 months. See the trend?\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay. Now. Here's the monthly revenue of a handful of dispensaries over that same period. See the trend?\n",
    "\n",
    "But we can show this better. Here's the average monthly change in revenue of a dispensary.\n",
    "Next to the change for the overall market. \n",
    "Next to variation in the S&P 500 over the same period.\n",
    "And now the top marijuana ETF out there.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we're going to make choices about what to invest in to make a dispensary successful, we need to have the impacts of the external market in context. So I put those indicators in there for some regression models to see how significant a role they played.\n",
    "\n",
    "In at attempt to both have more data and isolate the time component of my analysis, I constructed a new target variable, which is marketshare. For each month, I divided the revenue of a given dispensary by the revenue of all of the dispensaries over that period. "

    "# Obtain the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this project is derived from several sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dispensary profiles from [Leafly](www.leafly.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "Leafly is an information aggregator for cannabis. They maintain a profile for most of the dispensaries in the state. As part of my dataset, I've scraped the following features from the Leafly website for each dispensary for which it was available:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Average customer rating and number of customer reviews\n",
    "* Inventory counts (number of products under descriptions like \"flower\", \"edibles\", \"concentrates\", etc.\n",
    "* Categorical qualities, such as whether or not the store is ADA accessible or has an ATM onsite\n",
    "* Metadata such as name, address, phone number, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of these features gives us a profile of each dispensary that allow us to draw insights from our model into what makes for a successful dispensary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Demographics from [WA HomeTownLocator](https://washington.hometownlocator.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, having the best inventory, friendliest staff and prettiest building in the state doesn't amount to anything if a dispensary is in the middle of nowhere. This is where demographic data comes in. WA HomeTownLocator maintains a database of demographic statistics for nearly every zip code in the state of Washington. The data is produced by Esri Demographics, and updated 4 times per year using data from the federal census, IRS, USPS, as well as local data sources and more. From this website I scraped data likely to be predictive of a local market such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Population density\n",
    "* Diversity\n",
    "* Average income\n",
    "\n",
    "These data give our model an image of what a dispensary's customer base is like, allowing us to characterize what makes for a good location to establish a dispensary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## [Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board (WSLCB)](https://lcb.wa.gov/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, all that data would get us nowhere if we didn't have any target data to train our models on. That's where the WSLCB comes in. The WSLCB maintains data on every dispensary in the state, including monthly reports of revenue (which is what our model is predicting). Their data is scattered across a couple of different outlets, but for this project I used spreadsheets downloadable from [this obsure page](https://lcb.wa.gov/records/frequently-requested-lists) to get sales data dating back to November 2017. Because the only identifying information in that spreadsheet is the license number of the dispensary, I also downloaded a spreadsheet listing metadata for every entity that has applied for a Marijuana license, which I then joined with the sales data in order to link it up with data scraped from other resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below contains a pipeline to visit each of our sources and scrape or download all of the desired data into a few files stored in the data/raw/ directory to be scrubbed and processed later."
